# Face_detection_recognition
Face Detection and Recognition are build with Deep Learning Network


# Datasets
The database I used for face recognition is Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)  from University of Massachusetts.

# Caffe-model
After Fine-tuning VGG Caffe Model here: https://github.com/FeiWang810/Fine-tuning_VGG_CaffeNet, I use the trained model to do face detection and recognition.
